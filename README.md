# Early-Detection-of-Heart-Disease-using-Deep-Learning
Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Hybrid Sampling and Hybrid Deep learning algorithms

# Libraries used in code

numpy
pandas
sciket learn
tensorflow
keras
imblearn
sklearn

# Environment used
Visual Studio

# Note=> Libraries should be installed before running the code and should be up to date

# Steps involved in code
1. Preprocessing
2. vislization before sampling
3. Correlation analysis
4. Attribue selection
5. Hybrid Sampling
6. Visulization after sampling
7. Autoencoder to compress features
8. Feed those compressed features to RNN, CNN and DNN
9. Evaluation on test and validation dataset
10. 5 Cross Fold Validation
